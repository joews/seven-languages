# Install

I'm using Max OS 10.11 (El Capitan). I install packages with [brew](http://brew.sh/) where I can. This is how I installed each language:

## Io

    ❯ brew install io
    ❯ io --version
    Io Programming Language, v. 20140919

## Prolog

    ❯ brew install gnu-prolog
    ❯ gprolog --version
    Prolog top-Level (GNU Prolog) 1.4.4
